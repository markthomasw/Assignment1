   1) It allows you to keep one stable branch while continuing development
      in another branch without breaking the working branch.
   2) It allows you to try changes that may or may not ever be merged into
      the main code branch.

f) The difference is that git status shows the changes between the local clone
and the working branch on Github whereas git log lists all commits made to the 
branch.

g) git log --follow Weapon.h

h) git log --grep="file"

   I) Inheritance is used when there is an "is a" relationship meaning that a
      child class is a type of the parent class and therefor has all of the
      same attributes as the parent as well as some uniqu attributes of the child.
   II) Polymorphism is when you can treat an object as a generic version of something,
       yet when the class is accessed the data determines what versions of the generic
       methods are used.
   III) Encapsulation simply refers to containing both data and methods in one distinct 
        form (i.e. a class).

7) I believe this design is using both polymorphism and encapsulation. The project
   uses polymorphism in each of the child classes of Weapon in that they all overload
   the same virtual hit method. It displays encapsulation in that the Weapon class has
   both methods and data in a protected form.
